    <h2>Your Health Buddy</h2>
    <img src="../images/des191-work.jpg" alt="UI/UX App Project" class='images'>

    <p>This is a final project for my UI/UX class. Our objective was to create an app or a website that promotes equity. For my project, I decided to create an app for health care.</p>

    <p>Healthy Buddy is a free app for people who do not or can not afford health insurance. The main goal of Healthy Buddy is to keep its users as healthy as possible without the need of health insurance. This app targets users who do not have
      access to health insurance, especially recent graduates and people who work at home.</p>

    <p>The first key features in this app is a daily health feature. This is the area where users can track their calories, their exercise, heart rate and more. The second key feature is data entry. Users are able to put and organize all their
      medical records. If a user is missing a shot, the app will notify that user. The third key feature is a high tech self-diagnosis with AI. This is for simple self-diagnosis such as rashes, allergies, and all kinds of symptoms. If the diagnosis
      is severe, the app will locate the user to the nearest and cheapest clinic. The last and forth feature is the emergency fund account. This is where users can save up money just in case they need to go see a doctor. It shows the cost to see how
      much that user needs to save</p>

    <p>How the prototype works: This prototype only have 2 working tasks: the Daily Health and the Emergency Fund. The Daily Health is a linear step-by-step prototype and must complete each task to move on to the other. In The Emergency Fund, The
      user can either put their savings first or find different types of doctor appointments.</p>

    <p><b>Programs Used:</b> Adobe Illustrator and InvisionApp</p>
