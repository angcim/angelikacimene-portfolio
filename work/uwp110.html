    <h2>New Era Garden</h2>
    <img src="../images/uwp110-work.jpg" alt="User Experience" class='images'>

    <p>This is a group project that I had worked on for my UX Research course. For this class, we were given a real client to work with and create and/or redesign their website. </p>

    <p>For this project, we had to create a website for New Era Community to help expand their community and share their resources. For this group project, I had created and prototyped the whole website while my group did the research and user
      testing.</p>

    <p>Key features of the website include a login account, which is exclusive to members. With an account, members are allowed to log in their hours, pay their yearly dues, and post on the blog. There is an events page for socials and a blog page
      for articles. </p>

    <p>How the prototype works: There is no coding involved in this prototype. We used awebsite called InVision to create a function and clickable prototype. This website acts as actual website. <i>(Due to over a hundred images, the prototype itself
        is a little slow until all the screens have loaded up, so please be patient with it)</i></p>

    <p><b>Programs Used:</b> Adobe Illustrator and InvisionApp</p>

    <p><i>*All stock images used for the website are creditted to its rightful owners.</i></p>
