    <h2>About Me</h2>

    <img src="images/portrait.jpg" alt="Portrait" class="images">

    <p>My name is Angelika Cimene. I am a fourth year Design major and Professional Writing minor at University of California, Davis. My field in design is graphic design and marketing with an emphasis on web design and UI/UX. I also have knowledge
      in different types of graphic design such as poster design, branding, print design, and animation. I am incredibly passionate when it comes to my projects and work. Not only that, but I excel in creativity and imagination, as I am the type of
      person to think outside the box. I love to challenge myself and find ways of becoming a better designer for my clients and myself. I have a great eye for detail, and am more than happy to cater and listen to your design needs. </p>

    <p>During my spare time, I love to read classic novels, watch classic films and draw abstract graphic art. Even though I love to be a homebody, I also love to go out and get myself out there, and socialize with friends and acquaintances. If you
      would like to know more or need any graphic design work, feel free to contact me.<p>

        <p>Skills and Qualifications Include: Adobe Suites, Microsoft Suites, HTML, CSS, Processing. (I am currently learning JavaScript)</p>
